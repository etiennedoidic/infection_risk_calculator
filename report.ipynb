    "The global pandemic of COVID-19 has demonstrated the exceptional transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has highlighted the vulnerability of the built environment to airborne pathogens. For the past 40 years, Heat, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings have been optimized to recirculate conditioned air to save energy while maintaining a stable temperature [[Perez-Lombard et al. 2011]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.025). However, HVAC systems operators must now consider the dangers of air recirculation and aim to prevent the buildup of airborne particles or pathogens throughout buildings in order to ensure the health of occupants and the greater public. As buildings today reopen without a vaccine it is important to understand the risk of airborne infection based on building and occupant features, for not only the current pandemic, but for future ones as well. One method that has been developed to address this problem is the infection risk calculator. These calculators allow users to input variables such as the number of occupants,  room dimensions, air change per hour (ACH), masks/no masks, etc., in order to determine the risk of infected person(s) transmitting a virus to susceptible people the room [Lelieveld et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218114).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these calculators may be convenient in some cases, they are “black box” algorithms, meaning the underlying code is not accessible or transparent to users. With a large amount of skepticism surrounding the academic literature regarding this virus and its transmission [[Scheirer 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2020.1778361), we believe it is important infection risk calculators are as transparent as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we describe our methods for developing our own infection risk algorithm for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which accepts room data, and a set of parameters regarding occupants and infection rates of the surrounding community. Code and assumptions made in the algorithm will be clearly explained to users for transparency. "
